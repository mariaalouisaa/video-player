# video-player

Inspired by a take-home challenge (part of the Founders & Coders course) I have decided to create a JS video player, with custom made controls!

### Features include:

- Play & pause functionality
- Small screen to fullscreen
- Sound mute (toggle)
- Sound volume adjustable
- Personalised favicon
- Personalised styling for the range input bars.

--- 

### Still to add:

- Progress bar with functionality to change video play time
